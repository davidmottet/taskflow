# taskflow

A Flutter training project.

## Introduction

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application, designed primarily for learning purposes. It is inspired by a mobile app concept called [Task Flow](https://dribbble.com/shots/24963604-Task-Flow-Mobile-App-Concept) that you can view on Dribbble. This concept was created to help efficiently manage daily work priorities.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to provide a foundation for exploring and understanding state management principles in Flutter, while drawing inspiration from modern and aesthetic designs. It is not a complete application, but rather an exercise to get familiar with Flutter development.

## AI Assistance

This project is fully AI-assisted, meaning that every step of the development is supported by artificial intelligence tools to enhance efficiency and creativity.

## Time Constraint

This project was developed over the course of one weekend, during which I did not work on it 100% of the time.
